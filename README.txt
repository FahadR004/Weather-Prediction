ML CEP - Weather Dataset

To run the GUI interface of this notebook, upload the following to your jupyter 
notebook,
- non_parametric_models.pkl ( 3 models ) 
- parametric_models.pkl  ( 3 models ) 
- neural_networks.pkl ( 3 models )
- poly_features.pkl ( polynomial instance stored )
- xgb_scaler.pkl  ( StandardScaler instance used on XGB stored here )
- parametric_scaler.pkl  ( StandardScaler instance used on LR and MLP stored here)

Now, in the notebook, go to the last section 'GUI' and run the last two cells for 
predicting on the models.
- First cell will install gradio
- Second cell will run the gradio interface
